# Google Sheets JSON Demo
This is a test site to demo the use of Google sheets as an impromptu database. Google Sheet's ability to output live JSON allows a front end site to be hooked up to use a spreadsheet as a live data source.

The site link can be found [here](https://nahmadic.github.io/google-sheets-json/).
